This project implements a reaction game with HTML/CSS/Javascript. The game generates random shapes (squares, circles, diamonds, and triangles) with randomized sizes and colors at random positions on the page and then records the time it takes you to click on them. It records the best overall time, overall average time, and average time for each distinct shape. After 10 tries, the game will stop and display these basic stats for you. To try to beat your previous score, simply refresh and play again. The link to the result is [here](http://176.32.230.53/pwinslow-reaction-game.com/).
